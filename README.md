# Departmental Store Management System
this netbeans project is created only for learning java.

Departmental store management system is a program          
that helps to manage the store of a certain orga-          
nization, for example in university of Gondar              
there is a big store that other departments use            
and depend on in order to function properly. This          
program is intended to facilitate the function of          
such unit of an organization by providing the              
following functions.                                       
                                                           
-Managing recodes of properties that the store has:-       
 this has a certain advantage over the paper paced         
 system. By using this program store manager or any        
 other employee can instantly access the available         
 products that the store contain. By doing so not          
 only this system can save time but also money that        
 was wasted in the older system.                           
                                                           
-Managing the issued properties that the store doesn't     
 have:- this is important in a way that the issued pr-     
 oducts can be managed easily.                              
                                                           
-Recoding dispatched properties:- dispatched properties    
 are products that have been sent to other departments.    
 this way the store manager knows how it has performed     
 and how much money the store have served.                 
                                                           
-Producing and exporting reports to other file formats:-   
 one of the main feature of this program is its ability    
 to produce reports. This way one can easily understand    
 the performance of the store. And this reports can        
 easily be exported to other file formats, like word docu-    
 ments and spread sheet, for further analysis.
